# 1.8 Broker Provider Abstraction
This special chapter will discuss the providers brokers may rely on to execute a certain operation. Most Brokers rely on external libraries or routines that are not owned by the engineers developing the system. These external libraries may or may not follow best practices in terms of abstraction and testing.

The Standard mandates relying on standardized providers for systems design and development. These standardized providers must have the following charactristics:

## 1.8.0 Extensibility
Standardized abstract provider libraries must be extensidble to support more external providers. For instnace, a library that supports communicating with a database to SQL Server, must be extensible enough to support communicating with MongoDB or MariaDb or any other providers without any additional costs from the consumer of these libraries.
